The Body file has most of the classes that are used to store the physics data for the objects.

The 2 collision phases are first broad, and if it passes the broad then it does the narrow.
The Contacts file is the resolution of the collision, by using interpenetration and velocity.

The ForceGen file is the resolution of gravity and drag coefficients.

There are other files like the Physics controller which ticks the updates, and the Object_Physics which is just a component to attach to the GameObject (linking it to the custom physics).
